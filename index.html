            <p>
                Iâ€™m a front-end developer living in Chicago, Illinois. I love to work with new and emerging technology as much as I do
                vanilla Javascript and CSS. I also have a background in design and can be just as deadly with the Adobe Crative Suite
                as I am with a text editor.
