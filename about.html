        Hi! My name is Jake, and I grew up in Northeast, Minneapolis, otherwise known as the “Arts District.”

        I attended and graduated from a software development bootcamp, studying MEAN stack programing called Prime Academy. I
        have since been leveraging my development experience over the past two years to pair with my passion for computers and
        technology. This ties into a lifelong involvement in advertising and design, to give me a unique perspective and skill
        set.

        I found my love for advertising at an early age when I would sit in front of the television and watch infomercials
        instead of cartoons on saturday mornings. Early in life, my parents took me traveling all over the world, and it is a
        passion that remains instilled in me to this day. I’ve made it to four of the seven continents so far, I plan on making
        it to all seven.

        When I’m not creating, concepting and designing awesome work, I love to see live music at concerts and festivals.
        Reading up on new technology trends is a daily habit. My biggest guilty pleasure is my love of videogames and custom
        built keyboards, (yes, like the ones you type on). However, I try to keep physically active by bicycling frequently and
        spending my weekends outdoors.

        The best advice I have ever received is to learn something new everyday, I do my best to stick by that.
